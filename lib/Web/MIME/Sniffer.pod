=head1 NAME

Web::MIME::Sniffer - MIME type sniffer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Web::MIME::Sniffer;
  use Web::MIME::Type;
  my $ct = $response->get_headers_by_name ('Content-Type')->[-1];
  my $mime = defined $ct ? Web::MIME::Type->parse_web_mime_type ($ct) : undef;
  my $sniffer = Web::MIME::Sniffer->new;
  $sniffer->supported_image_types->{'image/jpeg'} = 1;
  $sniffer->supported_image_types->{'image/png'} = 1;
  $sniffer->supported_image_types->{'image/gif'} = 1;
  my $computed_mime = $sniffer->detect (
    $mime,
    (substr $response->body, 0, 1445),
  );
  warn $computed_mime->mime_type_portion;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::MIME::Sniffer> class is a MIME type sniffer for Web user
agents.  It implements the MIME sniffing algorithm of the MIME
Sniffing Standard.

=head1 METHODS

There are following methods:

=over 4

=item $sniffer = Web::MIME::Sniffer->new

Create a new instance of the sniffer.

=item $sniffer->supported_image_types->{$mime_type_portion} = $boolean

Whether the application supports the MIME type as an image type or
not.  This can affect the sniffing algorithm's result.

The hash key must be a MIME type portion (type followed by a C</>
followed by a subtype, without parameters) in lowercase, such as
C<image/png> or C<image/jpeg>.

This hash reference is empty by default.

=item $sniffer->supported_audio_or_video_types->{$mime_type_portion} = $boolean

Whether the application supports the MIME type as an audio or video
type or not.  This can affect the sniffing algorithm's result.

The hash key must be a MIME type portion (type followed by a C</>
followed by a subtype, without parameters) in lowercase, such as
C<image/png> or C<image/jpeg>.

This hash reference is empty by default.

=item $mime = $sniffer->detect ($mime, $bytes)

Run the sniffing alorithm.

The first argument must be a MIME type object (L<Web::MIME::Type>) or
C<undef>.  If the resource in question is an HTTP response, the MIME
type object created from the B<last> C<Content-Type> header value (see
the MIME Sniffing Standard) should be specified.  If parsing of the
header value returns C<undef>, or there is no C<Content-Type> header,
C<undef> should be specified.

The second arugment must be the resource header, i.e. first 1445 bytes
of the response body (see the MIME Sniffing Standard for details).

The method returns a MIME type object (L<Web::MIME::Type>)
representing the computed MIME type.

Please note that when the computed MIME type is different from the
supplied MIME type (i.e. the return value is different from the first
argument), the computed MIME type does not have parameters included in
the supplied MIME type.  Parameters, especially the C<charset>
parameter, should be taken from the supplied MIME type, as defined by
the relevant specifications.
