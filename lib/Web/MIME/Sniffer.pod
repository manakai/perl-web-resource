Web::MIME::Sniffer - MIME type sniffer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Web::MIME::Sniffer;
  use Web::MIME::Type;
  my $ct = $response->get_headers_by_name ('Content-Type')->[-1];
  my $mime = defined $ct ? Web::MIME::Type->parse_web_mime_type ($ct) : undef;
  my $sniffer = Web::MIME::Sniffer->new;
  my $sniffed_type = $sniffer->detect (
    $mime,
    (substr $response->body, 0, 1445),
    supported_image_types => {
      'image/jpeg' => 1, 'image/png' => 1, 'image/gif' => 1, # for example
    },
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::MIME::Sniffer> class is a MIME type sniffer for Web user
agents.  It implements the MIME sniffing algorithm of the MIME
Sniffing Standard.

=head1 METHODS

There are following methods:

=over 4

=item $sniffer = Web::MIME::Sniffer->new

Create a new instance of the sniffer.

=item $sniffed_type = $sniffer->detect ($mime, $bytes, $name => $value, ...)

Run the sniffing alorithm.

The first argument must be a MIME type object (L<Web::MIME::Type>) or
C<undef>.  If the resource in question is an HTTP response, the MIME
type object created from the B<last> C<Content-Type> header value (see
the MIME Sniffing Standard) should be specified.  If parsing of the
header value returns C<undef>, or there is no C<Content-Type> header,
C<undef> should be specified.

The second arugment must be the resource header, i.e. first 1445 bytes
of the response body (see the MIME Sniffing Standard for details).

The other arguments must be specified as key/value pairs from
following options:

=over 4

=item supported_image_types => {I<media-type> => I<boolean>, ...}

A reference to the hash that contains the list of supported
image types.

This parameter MUST be set to a reference to the hash
whose keys are Internet Media Types (without any parameter)
and whose values are whether image formats with those Internet Media Types
are supported or not.  A value MUST be true if and only
if the Internet Media Type is supported.

If this parameter is missing, then no image types are 
considered as supported.

=back

The method returns the computed MIME type.  The type is always
represented in lowercase.

B<In list context>, this method returns a list of 
official type and sniffed type.  Official type is the media
type as specified in the transfer protocol metadata,
without any parameters and in lowercase.
