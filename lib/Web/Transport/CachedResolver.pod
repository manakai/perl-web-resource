=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Web::Transport::PlatformResolver;
  use Web::Transport::CachedResolver;
  $resolver = Web::Transport::CachedResolver->new_from_resolver

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::Transport::CachedResolver> module defines a name resolver
which has a 60-seconds cache.

This module is a resolver (see L<Web::Transport/"RESOLVERS">).

=head1 METHOD

Following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $resolver = Web::Transport::CachedResolver->new_from_resolver ($resolver)

Create a resolver.

The argument must be a "real" resolver.  It must implement the
C<resolve> method which is compatible with
L<Web::Transport::PlatformResolver>'s C<resolve>.

=item $promise = $resolver->resolve ($host)

Resolve a domain.  The argument must be a host (L<Web::Host>).

The method returns a promise (L<Promise>), which is to be resolved
with the result.  If the host is a domain and is successfully resolved
into an IP address, or the host is an IP address, the promise is
resolved with a host (L<Web::Host>) representing that IP address.
Otherwise, it is resolved with C<undef>.
