=head1 NAME

Web::Transport::PKI::Generator - Factory methods of PKIX objects

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::Transport::PKI::Generator> module has factory methods to
create various PKIX related objects.

=head1 METHODS

There are following methods:

=over 4

=item $gen = Web::Transport::PKI::Generator->new

Create a new instance of the generator.

=item $rsa = $gen->create_rsa_key ($name => $value, ...)

Create a new RSA key pair, using OpenSSL via L<Net::SSLeay>.  The
L<Web::Transport::PKI::RSAKey> object representing the created key is
returned.

Following option can be specified as name/value pair:

=over 4

=item bits => $int (Default: auto)

The bit length of the created key, as an integer.  In this version,
the default is C<2048>.

=back

=item $cert = $gen->create_certificate ($name => $value, ...)

Create a new X.509 certificate, using OpenSSL via L<Net::SSLeay>.  The
L<Web::Transport::PKI::Certificate> object representing the created
certificate is returned.

Following options can be specified as name/value pairs:

=over 4

=item version => $int? (Default: 2)

The version of the certifcate.  The value must be one of C<0> (v1),
C<1> (v2), or C<2> (v3).

=item serial_number => $bigint? (Default: 0)

The serial number of the certificate.  The value must be an integer or
a L<Math::BigInt> object.

=item not_before => $dt (Required)

The not before of the validity of the certificate.  The value must be
a Unix time number or a L<Web::DateTime> object.

=item not_after => $dt (Required)

The not after of the validity of the certificate.  The value must be a
Unix time number or a L<Web::DateTime> object.

=item issuer => $name (Required)

The issuer of the certificate.  The value must be a value that is
valid as the argument to the C<create> method of the
L<Web::Transport::PKI::Name> class.

=item subject => $name (Required)

The subject of the certificate.  The value must be a value that is
valid as the argument to the C<create> method of the
L<Web::Transport::PKI::Name> class.

=item rsa => $rsa (Required)

The RSA key used to sign the certifciate.  The value must be a
L<Web::Transport::PKI::RSAKey> object.

=item ca => $boolean

If true, certificate fields are configured for typical CA
certificates.

=item ee => $boolean

If true, certificate fields are configured for typical EE
certificates.

=item path_len_constraint => $integer?

The pathLenConstraint value of the basic constraints extension of the
certificate, if any, or C<undef>.

=item crl_urls => [$string1, $string2, ...]

The CRL distribution point URLs of the certificate.  If specified, the
value must be an array reference of character strings representing the
URLs.

=item aia_ocsp_url => $string?

The OCSP URL of the Authority Information Access extension of the
certificate as a character string, if any, or C<undef>.

=item aia_ca_issuers_url => $string?

The CA issuers URL of the Authority Information Access extension of
the certificate as a character string, if any, or C<undef>.
