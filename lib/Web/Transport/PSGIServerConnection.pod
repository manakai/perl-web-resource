=head1 NAME

Web::Transport::PSGIServerConnection - PSGI interface for HTTP server connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $psgi_app = sub { ... };
  tcp_server $host, $port, sub {
    my $con = Web::Transport::PSGIServerConnection
        ->new_from_app_and_ae_tcp_server_args ($psgi_app, [@_]);
    $con->completed->then (sub {
      warn "Client disconnected and PSGI application done";
    });
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::Transport::PSGIServerConnection> module is an
implementation of HTTP server and PSGI.  It wraps an HTTP server's TCP
connection socket and processes any incoming request by a PSGI
application.

=head1 METHODS

There are following methods:

=over 4

=item $con = Web::Transport::PSGIServerConnection->new_from_app_and_ae_tcp_server_args ($app, [...], NAME => VALUE, ...)

Create an object.

The first argument must be a PSGI application, i.e. a code reference.
See the PSGI specification for the requirements on the code reference.

The second argument must be an array reference of the arguments
received by the C<AnyEvent::Socket::tcp_server>'s callback.  That is,
the filehandle of the socket, the remote host, and the remote port (if
TCP).  The socket can be of a TCP or UNIX socket domain.

Additionally, options can be specified as key/value pairs.  The
C<parent_id> argument, if any, specifies the short string that
identifies the "parent" context in which the connection appears, which
will be used in debug outputs.

=item $con->onexception ($code)

=item $code = $con->onexception

Get or set the callback code reference that is invoked when an error
is detected while interacting with the PSGI application such that the
server returns an error response to the client.

The callback has to be set as soon as the object has been created and
it should not be changed later.

The callback can return a promise, to delay the resolution of the
C<complated> promise until the promise is resolved or rejected.

=item $con->max_request_body_length ($integer)

=item $integer = $con->max_request_body_length

Get or set the maximum length of the request body to be accepted by
the server, in bytes.  If C<undef>, no limit is set.

Note that the server loads the whole request body on memory, as the
server has to notify the request body's length of the PSGI application
at the time of invocation.

=item $promise = $con->completed

Return a promise (L<Promise>) which will be resolved once the
connection between the server and the client has been closed and the
PSGI application has been completed.

An invocation of PSGI application is considered as completed when
either a complete response is returned by the PSGI application or the
PSGI application invoked the C<< $writer->close >> method, and the
C<psgix.exit_guard> condvar's callback is invoked.

=item $string = $con->id

A short string assigned to the server connection, which can be used
for debugging purposes.  It is composed from the C<parent_id> option
to the constructor, if any.
