=head1 NAME

Web::Transport::PlatformResolver - Resolve domain names using platform's resolver

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Web::Transport::PlatformResolver;
  $resolver = Web::Transport::Resolver->new;
  $resolver->resolve (Web::Host->parse_string ("example.com"))->then (sub {
    warn defined $_[0] && $_[0]->stringify;
  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::Transport::PlatformResolver> module defines a name resolver
which resolves names using the system's resolution API.

This module is a resolver (see L<Web::Transport/"RESOLVERS">).

=head1 METHOD

Following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $resolver = Web::Transport::PlatformResolver->new

Create a resolver.

=item $promise = $resolver->resolve ($host)

Resolve a domain.  The argument must be a host (L<Web::Host>).

The method returns a promise (L<Promise>), which is to be resolved
with the result.  If the host is a domain and is successfully resolved
into an IP address, or the host is an IP address, the promise is
resolved with a host (L<Web::Host>) representing that IP address.
Otherwise, it is resolved with C<undef>.

The C<no_cache> named argument is ignored for this resolver (for now,
at least).  That is, the platform's DNS cache can't be disabled.
