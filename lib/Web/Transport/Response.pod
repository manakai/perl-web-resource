=head1 NAME

Web::Transport::Response - Responses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  if ($res->is_network_error) {
    warn $res->network_error_message;
  } else {
    warn $res->status, "\t", $res->status_text;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Web::Transport::Response> object represents a response, to be
returned by L<Web::Transport::Connection> and
L<Web::Transport::WSClient>.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are available:

=over 4

=item $boolean = $res->is_network_error

Whether the response represents a network error or not.  A network
error is a fatal error of the connection, including failures to
establish a connection, non-recoverable parsing errors of an HTTP
message, and unexpected termination of connection.

=item $string = $res->network_error_message

A human-readable short description of the network error, if any.

=item $integer = $res->status

If the response represents an HTTP response, the status code of the
response.

If the response represents a WebSocket connection close event, the
WebSocket connection close code.

=item $integer = $res->ws_code

The WebSocket connection close code.  Unlike C<< $res->status >>, this
method can be used when the response does not represent a WebSocket
connection close event (e.g. network error).

=item $string = $res->status_text

If the response represents an HTTP response, the reason phrase of the
response (bytes).

If the response represents a WebSocket connection close event, the
WebSocket connection close reason (text).

=item $text = $res->ws_reason

The WebSocket connection close reason.  Unlike C<< $res->status_text
>>, this method can be used when the response does not represent a
WebSocket connection close event (e.g. network error).

=item $boolean = $res->ws_closed_cleanly

Whether the WebSocket connection has been closed cleanly or not.  This
method can be used when the response does not represent a WebSocket
connection close event (e.g. network error).

=item $bytes = $res->body_bytes

The response body, if any.

=item $boolean = $res->incomplete

Whether it is an incomplete message or not.

=item $text = '' . $res

=item $text = $res->stringify

A human-readable short string describing the response.

The stringify operation of the response object is overloaded such that
throwing the response as (uncaught) exception would print the string.
